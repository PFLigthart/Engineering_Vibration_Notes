    \chapter{Chapter 1 - Introduction to vibration and free response}

      \begin{fmd-definition}{Degree of freedom}
        The degree of freedom of a system is the minimum number of displacement coordinates needed to represent the position of the systems mass at any instant of time.
      \end{fmd-definition}

      \begin{fmd-definition}{Free response}
        Free response refers to analysing the vibration of a system resulting from a non-zero inital displacement and/or velocity of the system with no external force or moment applied.
      \end{fmd-definition}
  
      \section{The spring-mass model}
        The fundamental kinematic quantities used to describe the motion of a particle are displacement, velocity, and acceleration vectors.

        \begin{fmd-definition}{Kinematic}
          Kinematic quantities are those that describe the motion of a particle without regard to the forces that cause the motion.
        \end{fmd-definition}
