\chapter{Chapter 4 - Multiple-degree-of-freedom systems}

More than one degree of freedom means more than one natural frequency. To keep record of each coordinate in the system, vectors are introduced and used along with matrices.

  \section{Two-degree-of-freedom model (undamped)}
    In moving from single-degree-of-freedom systems to two or more degrees of freedom, two important physical phenomena result.

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The first important difference is that ta two-degree-of-freedom system will have two natural frequencies
      \item The second important phenomenon is that of a mode shape, which is not present in single-degree-of-freedom systems. A mode shape is a vector that described the relative motion between the two masses or between tow degrees of freedom.
    \end{enumerate}

  These important concepts of multiple natural frequencies and mode shapes are intimately tied to the mathematical concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of computational matrix theory.

  \Cref{fig:simple_2_dof_model_of_two_masses_connected_in_series_by_two_springs} shows a simple two-degree-of-freedom system. The two masses are connected in series by two springs. Each mass only has a single degree of freedom because it can only move in a single direction. However, when considering the effect of the masses on one another, to completely described the system, two coordinates, namely $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are needed. That is to say, the two coordinates depend on each other.
